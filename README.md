# I94 Immigration Data Pipeline
## Data Engineering Capstone Project
### Project Summary
The objective of this project is to create an ETL pipeline for I94 immigration, global temperatures and US demographics datasets to form an analytics database on immigration events over time. The resulting database will enable analysis on externalities within non-US countries as well as US states which could deliver insight on some of the less obvious factors surrounding immigration to the US.

#### The project follows the following steps:

Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
Step 3: Define the Data Model
Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
